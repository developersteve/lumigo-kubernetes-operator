# Usage

This image contains the latest version of the Lumigo OpenTelemetry distributions for Java, Node.js and Python, alongside the Lumigo Injector, which enables the activation of the Lumigo OpenTelemetry distributions in compatible runtimes inside your containers.

This container image should be used through:

* the [Lumigo Kubernetes operator](https://docs.lumigo.io/docs/lumigo-kubernetes-operator)
* the Amazon ECS tracing provided by the [Lumigo CDK constructs](https://docs.lumigo.io/docs/aws-cdk#monitoring-aws-cdk-2-applications)

If you are interested in how the Lumigo Injector works in conjunction with the Lumigo OpenTelemetry distributions, have a look at ["The Magic Behind the Lumigo Kubernetes Operator"](https://lumigo.io/blog/the-magic-behind-the-lumigo-kubernetes-operator/) on the [Lumigo blog](https://lumigo.io/blog/).
